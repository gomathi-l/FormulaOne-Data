# FormulaOne + Data
Exploring F1 through data.

This repository accompanies my Medium blog, which explores Formula 1 through data analysis. Each article leverages Python-based tools and publicly available datasets to uncover patterns and insights in Formula One.

Each article is organized into its own folder, named using the format:

`[ArticleNumber]-[DateOfPublication]`

For example:  
`01-010125` refers to Article 1, published on January 1, 2025.

This structure helps in locating the relevant code, notebooks, and visualizations associated with each article.
