# FormulaOne + Data

This repository supports my articles on Medium, which explore Formula 1 through data analysis. Each article leverages Python-based tools and publicly available datasets to uncover patterns and insights in Formula One.

Each article is organized into its own folder, named using the format:

`[ArticleNumber]-[DateOfPublication(YYYYMMDD)]`

For example:  
`01-20250108` refers to Article 1, published on January 8, 2025.

This structure helps in locating the relevant code, notebooks, and visualizations associated with each article.
